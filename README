Bio-Glite version 0.01
======================

Bio::Glite is an interface to G-language Genome Analysis Environment
through its REST web service (http://www.g-language.org). This module
allows almost everything G-language GAE can do, without installing
all necessary tookits and modules. 

Advantage of this module over the standard installation of G-language 
GAE package is:
   1. Easy installation from CPAN
   2. Extremely light-weight (less than 1000 lines of code)
   3. Does not require much CPU/RAM (all calculation is done on the cloud)
Disadvantages includes:
   1. Slower analysis speed
   2. Internet connection is required
   3. No other software interfaces such as the G-language Shell

Quick Example:

      use Bio::Glite;

      my $gb = load('mgen'); # could also be a local GenBank/EMBL/FASTA file, or an accession number

      foreach my $cds ($gb->cds()){
          say ">" . $gb->{$cds}->{gene};
          say $gb->{$cds}->{translation};
      }

      gcskew($gb, -cumulative=>1, -at=>1);

      say $gb->{filename};

      say gcsi($gb);
